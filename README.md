# Projectile Motion Game

## Modules Used
- Turtle
- Time
- Math

## Description

This game uses turtle as the main GUI, to draw objects and collect user input.
Simple kinematics equations were used to calculate the trajectory path of the projectile
The grid in the background gives the player a visual sense to visualise the distance between the target and the object.

This game was created as part of a python course module in my first term at SUTD.
For context, this game ws created with less than 3 months of experience in Python.
